Resources for CSS created by Olly.

###Â Starter Activity in Intro to HTML Folder
- Give individuals "Fix the Repo Answers" folder if possible through Circle. CSS stylesheet has instructions for starter activity to get people started while they wait around for others. 
- Very basic stylesheet with no CSS Grid or Flexbox so they can add CSS Grid if they want to. 
- There is one error in the CSS sheet already (missing semicolon).

### FlexBox
1. flex.html shows Flexbox vs CSS Grid

### Image Gallery
1. gallery-grid.html and gallery-flex.html show very basic image gallery. Use to show basics of image CSS and using flexbox to make cards. No figures or figcaptions and kept the same image for simplicity.
